# TODO

- [ ] Ensure titles are the correct level, i.e., h1, h2, etc.
- [ ] Render a `x` for all variables with IDE-like pop up. [POC](https://twitter.com/timacdonald87/status/1647049647729553408).
- [ ] Render a `f` for all functions with IDE-like pop up. [POC](https://twitter.com/timacdonald87/status/1647049647729553408).
- [ ] Render a `C` for all constants with IDE-like pop up. [POC](https://twitter.com/timacdonald87/status/1647049647729553408).
- [ ] Abbreviations and Acronyms should have a title where they aren't described within the sentence.
- [ ] Ensure examples using `figure` scales.
- [ ] The "PHP Manual" navigation item, the "PHP Manual" title on the preface page, and the "PHP Manual" HTML page need to be manually omitted.
- [x] The `code` tags are forcing the font size when used in other elements, such as headings. Need a better way to make code blocks small while allowing parents to override.
- [ ] Pull "see also" up into sidebar
- [ ] The homepage should contain the menu in full completely expanded.
- [ ] Empty pages should include a redirect to their overview page.
- [ ] Links should retain their color even when they contain a `code` snippet. Currently the inline code overrides the link color.
- [ ] We should have a dedicated `class` property to accompany `attributes`
- [ ] Function index not handling parameter union types correctly.
